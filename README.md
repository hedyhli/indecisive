*WIP*

[Demo](https://indecisive.hedy.dev/)

stack
- js - SolidJS (a *teeny* little bloat) (but I get to have the possibly
  delusional sense of perfectly managed *fine-grained reactivity*)
- css - bulma (a *little* blaot) (but I get to write 0 lines of custom css)

the resulting build is > 700kB, but, well, for now I'll get the features and
stability in.

- build: `pnpm build`
- live reloading server (vite): `pnpm dev`
